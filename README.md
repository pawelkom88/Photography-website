## About The Project

JOE DOE PHOTOGRAPHY is a dummy fully responsive photography website built with Next.js and Framer
Motion.

## Demo

Here is a working [live demo ](https://joe-doe-photography.netlify.app/)

## How I worked on this project

My goal was to practice basics of React and Next.js.

- I used
- I used feature branches and Pull Requests

## How to navigate this project

- Stateful logic: [Link to example code on GitHub]

- Responsive CSS using Sass:
  [Navigation bar](https://github.com/pawelkom88/outletity/blob/main/src/components/header/Header.scss)

- The application fetches data from the Fake Store API: Examples for the request
  [useFetch hook](https://github.com/pawelkom88/outletity/blob/main/src/hooks/useFetch.js) and data
  transformation [to be done]()

- User data is saved in Firebase, which also handles authentication proccess. (to be done)

- Integration tests using React Testing Library: [Link to example test on GitHub] (to be done)

## Why I built the project this way

E-commerce ...

- I didn't use a state management library like Redux on purpose. For this app simple `useState` and
  built-in `useReducer` is sufficient.

- Sass is great for styling. To make styling easier I used variables, mixins, custom breakpoints.

- My plan is to become a professional front-end developer eventually. I decided to use an existing
API rather to create a custom server.
<!--
- Testing is an essential part of production applications. Testing Library is the go-to library in
  the React community. I covered the essential features of the app with tests. -->
