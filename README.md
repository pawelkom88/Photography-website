## About The Project

JOE DOE PHOTOGRAPHY is a dummy fully responsive photography website built with Next.js and Framer
Motion.

## Demo

Here is a working [live demo ](https://joe-doe-photography.netlify.app/)

## How I worked on this project

My goal was to practice, React and Next.js features.

- I used Framer Motion library for animations and page transitions
- I used feature branches and Pull Requests

## How to navigate this project

- The application fetches data from the Pexels API: Examples for the request
  [useFetch hook](https://github.com/pawelkom88/Photography-website/blob/main/hooks/useFetch.js) 

- Integration tests using React Testing Library: [Link to example test on GitHub] (to be done)

## Why I built the project this way
